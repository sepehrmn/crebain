/**
 * Reply `ncp_version` guard — CREBAIN-specific TS glue over `@sepehrmn/ncp`.
 *
 * The canonical `NeuroSimClient` stamps `ncp_version` on every *request* but the
 * package does not validate the version carried on a *reply*: its `unwrap` only
 * rejects `{ kind: 'error', … }` frames. A peer (Engram/Paper2Brain) that drifts
 * to an incompatible protocol could therefore hand CREBAIN a reply whose shape no
 * longer matches the pinned bindings, and we would parse it as a success.
 *
 * This is the one place the `src/neuro` README reserves for CREBAIN-specific glue:
 * a thin, transport-agnostic wrapper that decorates any `Send` so that every
 * non-error reply must carry an `ncp_version` equal to the version this build
 * speaks (`NCP_VERSION`, "0.3"). It changes no wire bytes — NCP stays pinned at
 * v0.3.0 — it only refuses to trust a reply that claims a different protocol.
 *
 * Error frames (`{ kind: 'error', … }`) and primitive replies are passed through
 * untouched so the package's own `unwrap`/error handling keeps working; only a
 * reply object that *has* an `ncp_version` field (or is missing one when one is
 * expected) is checked.
