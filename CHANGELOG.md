# Changelog

All notable changes to CREBAIN are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This project is a research prototype; capability statuses are tracked in the
README and treated as unverified until measured on target hardware.

## [Unreleased]

Open-source readiness and quality hardening.

### Added

- ESLint (typescript-eslint type-checked + react-hooks) and Prettier, wired into
  `bun run validate`; `.editorconfig`.
- Frontend coverage via `@vitest/coverage-istanbul` with regression-ratchet
  thresholds; an initial-bundle size budget guard (`bun run check:bundle`).
- `rust-toolchain.toml` pinning the toolchain; enforced `cargo fmt` and the
  `clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks` lint.
- AppHandle-backed IPC integration tests (Tauri mock runtime) and a
  constant-velocity fusion tracking scenario; render smoke tests for the viewer
  panels.
- CI hardening (least-privilege permissions, concurrency, rust-cache, bundle and
  coverage gates) plus new workflows: CodeQL, OpenSSF Scorecard, supply-chain
  audit (cargo-deny + bun audit), tag-triggered Tauri release, Nix flake check,
  ROS-definition validation, and scheduled benchmarks.
- Supply-chain policy via `src-tauri/deny.toml` (advisories/licenses/bans/
  sources), enforced in CI. Dependencies are reviewed and updated periodically
  rather than via automated Dependabot PRs.
- Governance: `CODEOWNERS`, structured issue forms, `SUPPORT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`,
  `CITATION.cff`, and a committed `flake.lock`.
- `docs/SENSOR_FUSION.md`: a full sensor-fusion design reference (estimation math,
  the per-modality coordinate/covariance contract, data association and gating,
  multi-sensor fusion semantics, track lifecycle, tuning, validation metrics, and
  known limitations), with an expanded and corrected README section.

### Changed

- Renamed the Rust crate `app` → `crebain` (lib `crebain_lib`).
- Replaced `lazy_static` with `std::sync::LazyLock`; made rosbridge mutex locking
  panic/poison tolerant.
- Began decomposing `CrebainViewer` (extracted `HeaderBar` and `DetectionPanel`);
  added a typed three.js traversal/disposal helper and removed duplicated logic.
- Corrected repository URLs and metadata; fixed the stale `index.html` title.
- Bumped `rustls-webpki` to a patched release.

### Fixed

- **Sensor fusion — radar/lidar coordinate frame.** Radar measurements are now kept
  in native polar `[range, azimuth, elevation]` end-to-end (consumed by the EKF
  polar model), and lidar is treated as a Cartesian centroid. Previously the
  TypeScript bridge converted both to Cartesian while the Rust core re-interpreted
  them as polar — a double conversion that corrupted every radar and lidar track on
  the default EKF path. Radar measurement noise is now specified in polar units.
- **Sensor fusion — covariance numerical stability.** The KF and EKF covariance
  updates use the Joseph stabilized form `(I−KH)P(I−KH)ᵀ + KRKᵀ`, and the UKF
  symmetrizes its covariance after each update, keeping `P` symmetric and
  positive-semidefinite under round-off (preventing the UKF Cholesky failures the
  diagonal fallback was masking).
- **Sensor fusion — ROS timestamp deserialization.** Per-measurement `timestamp_ms`
  is rounded to an integer at the bridge; a sub-millisecond ROS nanosecond remainder
  (the common case) previously produced a fractional value that failed `u64`
  deserialization and rejected the entire fusion batch.
- **Sensor fusion — IMM likelihood normalizer** corrected to the 3-D
  multivariate-Gaussian form `√((2π)³·det S)` (was the 1-D form).
- **Sensor fusion — coasting velocity spike.** The browser multi-camera tracker now
  records the predicted position during coasting, so velocity on re-acquisition is no
  longer inflated by dividing a multi-frame displacement by a single-frame `dt`.
- **Sensor fusion — χ²-calibrated association gate.** Association now gates on the
  squared Mahalanobis distance against a χ²(3) threshold (default `11.345` ≈ 99 %
  gate) instead of a non-squared distance versus a magic `10.0`; the singular-
  covariance fallback is squared and normalized to the same scale. Defaults updated
  across the Rust core and the TS config sites.
- **Sensor fusion — track-birth velocity prior.** A track born from a single
  position-only measurement now seeds a wide velocity prior (σ_v ≈ 20 m/s, Bar-Shalom
  single-point initiation) instead of an over-confident σ_v ≈ 3 m/s. Previously a
  genuinely moving target could fall outside the (correctly tightened) χ²(3) gate on
  its second frame and fragment into a duplicate track.
- **Sensor fusion — radar association frame consistency.** The association gate now
  expresses radar's polar measurement noise in the Cartesian gate frame via the
  polar→Cartesian Jacobian (`R_cart = J⁻¹ R J⁻ᵀ`) rather than adding polar
  `[m², rad², rad²]` directly to a Cartesian position covariance, which had badly
  under-estimated cross-range uncertainty (an angular σ at range R spans ≈ R·σ).
- **Sensor fusion — unified threat formula.** `calculate_threat_level` (Rust) and
  `getThreatLevel` (TS) now share one graduated 1–4 formula over a shared label
  mapping (`map_to_detection_class` mirrors `mapToDetectionClass`): drone threat
  graduates 2 → 3 → 4 with confidence and unknowns escalate to 3 above 0.7
  confidence, removing the engines' prior divergence in both the formula and the
  label bucketing.
- **Docs.** Corrected the README threat-level scale (1–4, no level 0), the track
  state-machine transitions (to match the Rust implementation), and the association
  threshold description (a unitless Mahalanobis distance, not meters).

### Removed

- Unused `core-graphics` and `core-foundation` Rust dependencies.

## [0.4.0] - 2026
